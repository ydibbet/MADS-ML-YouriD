    "Previous lessons, you have started to experiment with you model.\n",
    "You might have tested the impact of the amount of units, the depth of layers and different learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson, we have added some new types of layers: convolutional and pooling layers.\n",
    "Experiment with adding these new layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, have a look at the `ModuleList`: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ModuleList.html#modulelist\n",
    "It can be really useful to create a list of layers from a configfile, and then use that list to create your model.\n",
    "Instead of just adding a single layer, you could also add a block of layers (eg a Conv2d layer, followed by a ReLU layer, followed by a BatchNorm2d layer, followed by a MaxPool2d layer) and repeat that in a loop, adding it to the `ModuleList`.\n",

    "Expand your training pipeline you started in the previous lesson such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- you can switch between models by changing a config file\n",
    "- you can test different hyperparameters by changing a config file\n",
    "- you automatically log settings: model picked, hyperparameters, metrics, etc. : use either gin-config, tensorboard or MLFlow to log that, or a combination, whatever you prefer.\n",
    "- Important: doing a master means you don't just start engineering a pipeline, but you need to reflect. Why do you see the results you see? What does this mean, considering the theory? Write down lessons learned and reflections, based on experimental results.\n",
    "- continuously improve your code: \n",
    "    - clean up your experimental environment, such that it doesnt get too messy\n",
    "    - automate the boring stuff: use a Makefile, use configfiles, automate logging, etc.\n",
    "    - use git: commit your changes often and with descriptive messages\n",
    "    - separate code for pipelines, configs, models, modeltraining and results."
